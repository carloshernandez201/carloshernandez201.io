I Was watching this video and bro mentioned how the blockchain could be applied teven to determining traffic intersections: that is so freaking
cool I had never thought that this could really be applied to more than exchange related things (as this is technically an exchange/negotiation
in a distributed setting by computers (in AVs))

Darn that looks so cool and I found theres an open source autonomous vehiocle software.

The one thing is: I am def uncertain wtf I can do here, wtf I can contribute. But obv that prolly means im learning or something
