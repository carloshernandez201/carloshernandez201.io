What Is This

This is a series where I track my learning. I am taking on a new challenge of learning something tech related every day and building something tech related and posting on it here.

Today
Today I learned about the blockchain, and an overview on how it works. Here I present my learnings.

- The blockchain's main appeal is how it is distributed and also immutable.
-  It's distributed nature comes from the fact that every node in the blockcahin keeps track of every block in the chain. Therefore, this can lead to no "centralization" from a systems pov.

- It's immutability is a key feature of its security appeal and comes from the block data itself. At a high level:

- Every block represents some transactions plus a hash code plus the previous neighbor's hash code.

- The hash code is composed of: hash(transactions + prevHashCode + other stuff). Therefore, to alter any transactions in the block once its set, one would change the hash value of that block which would change the hash value of every block and alert everyone of the security vulnerability.

As for how new transactions are recorded, this happens as 1. After a transaction, the participants post it onto an acceptance "queue" 2. The nodes running the blockchain try to solve a proof of validity algoriuthm by basically running a brute force algorithm on the blocks of these transactions (whoever solves this will be payed a fee for verification) 3. This then is communicated direclty peer to peer from every npde onwards


It is truly fascinating how this sysetm is able to offer decentralized security. As an outsider looking for critical thinking practice, here are some issues I 
may see popping up:
- This is incredibly resource intensive
- I wonder how much it costs to pay to validate a transaction
- Apart from that i guess this system's decentralization makes it more robust
  - if i wree to guess, the bottleneck for blockchain is it's resource intensiveness, which may be fixed throyugh more efficient algorithms +
  - how its decentralization + enccryption can make it complicated for regular people to learn, slowing the adoption curve
 
  - I also heard how this technology can lead to smart contracts, which sound like a great idea for appliacble situations and may make business more effective and even trustworthy
 
Build:

I have built a very naive simulation of the blockchain as a Block class and a chain linked list class. Here it is

`{python}
import hashlib
import time
import json


class Block:    
    def __init__(self, index, previous_hash, timestamp, data):
        self.index = index
        self.previous_hash = previous_hash
        self.timestamp = timestamp
        self.data = data
        self.hash = self.calculate_hash()
        
        #nonce would represent a guesser block

    def calculate_hash(self):
        block_to_string = f"{self.index}{self.previous_hash}{self.timestamp}{self.data}"
        return hash(block_to_string.encode())
    

class Blockchain:
    def __init__(self):
        self.chain = []
        self.create_genesis_block()
    def create_genesis_block(self):
        genesis_block = Block(0,"0", time.time(), "Genesis Block")
        self.chain.append(genesis_block)
    
    def add_block(self, data):
        last_block = self.chain[-1]
        new_block = Block(len(self.chain), last_block.hash, time.time(), data)
        self.chain.append(new_block)
{}
