Im super tired its super late lets keep shi short last time i looked at opensource AV tech.


I found it cool how blockchain really is more than money, its any system where decentralized p2p comms may come in handy aka a shit ton of graphs/systems like avs

Ethereum:
- Next iteration of blockcahin, became a open source platform for decentralized apps that can be powered by these technologies. Every DApp running on etheruem is on teh same daatabse as any other dapp and
- can I think call on the function of eberything straught up NO API KEY. u can get all sorts of data and get all sorts of shit

- ecompare to the gated web2 neghborhoods web3 is like a favela w hella interactions, damn thats why shi is intersitng'

- da real challenge from now on is scalabilit + efficiency (blockcahin 3 issues)

- ts is super cool for now imma see how tf u build an etheruem app

sick today i syarted buildiong an etherum app and i can build a contract off anythign anysones ever done ever cool
